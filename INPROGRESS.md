Tool / Armor progression:

- Wood / Chainmail
- Stone
- Iron / Gold
- Diamond / Terminite
- Crystalite (Armor only)
- Lonsdaleite
- Perfect Lonsdaleite
- Netherite
- Gilded Netherite
- Ametrine  (Armor only) / Pendorite (Tools only)
- Aeternium

- Special Cases:
  - The "Peacekeeper" sword is slightly better than Diamond/Terminite, but not as good as Netherite.
  - The "Knightfall" sword is better than an Aeternium sword and therefore most likely the best weapon currently in the game.
  - There is a "Gilded Shield", made by combining a Diamond Scrap with a normal Shield in a Smithing Table. Diamond Scraps are made by combining one diamond and eight gold nuggets.
  - Lonsdaleite and Perfect Lonsdaleite provide an Omnitool which functions like a pickaxe, shovel and axe. Their tool levels are Diamond and Netherite, respectively.

- Terminite gear is equivalent to Diamond gear - sometimes slightly better, sometimes slightly worse. Terminite Ingots are made by combining an Iron Ingot with End Dust.

- Crystalite armor is made by infusing Terminite armor with Crystal Shards and Amber Gems and can be seen as the equivalent of the Diamond -> Netherite upgrade. Crystalite armor is not as good as Netherite armor.

- Lonsdaleite tools and armor can be seen as an alternative to Netherite that does not require visiting the Nether. Lonsdaleite tools are made using Lonsdaleite Gems, which can be created by smelting Prepared Lonsdaleite. Prepared Lonsdaleite is made by combining 8 Diamonds with 1 Obsidian in a Crafting Table.

- Perfect Lonsdaleite tools and armor are only slightly better than Lonsdaleite tools and armor, but have a noticeably higher durability. Perfect Lonsdaleite Armor is made in the same way, with one exception. Instead of using the Lonsdaleite Gem immediately to craft the armor or tool, the gem is placed back into the furnace for a second round of hardening. The armor or tool can then be built using the perfected version.

- Netherite armor and Netherite tools are made by combining the Diamond version of the tool with a Netherite Ingot in a Smithing Table.

- Gilded Netherite Armor and Tools are made by upgrading Diamond armor using a Gilded Netherite Ingot in a Smithing Table. Gilded Netherite Ingots can be made by combining a Netherite ingot with one diamond and seven gold nuggets.

- Ametrine armor is made by combining a Netherite tool or Gilded Netherite tool with an Ametrine gem in a Smithing table. There are no Ametrine tools.

- Pendorite tools are made by combining a Netherite tool or Gilded Netherite tool with a Pendorite scrap in a Smithing table. There is no Ametrine Armor.

- Aeternium armor and Aeternium tools are made in the normal way in a Crafting Table using Aeternium Ingots. Aeternium Ingots are made by combining a Netherite Ingot with a Terminite Ingot. Aeternium gear is a very slight upgrade from Ametrine or Pendorite gear.
