# Fett.lol Util Mod

This mod adds a number of minor tweaks that were desired on the `fett.lol` Minecraft server. Some
of these are inspired by other mods, where we just wanted a small portion of what that mod did and
did not want to install the entire mod. Others are completely novel and are of our own creation. 
Another couple are recreations of mods that have been lost to the sands of time as Minecraft
continued to be updated while the mod was not.

To make this mod as enjoyable as possible to people who want to use it in their own single-player
worlds or servers, each tweak and adjustment in this mod can be turned on or off, although all of
them default to true.

## The List of Implemented Tweaks

- **Villagers follow players holding Emerald Blocks** Just like sheep, cows, chicken and other
  animals will follow the food thaht they love most, villagers will also follow what it is they
  love most; Emeralds. However, not just any emerald will do, we have to entice them with an entire
  Emerald Block! Also, given that they're not animals, villagers can be a bit skittish and often
  lose their concentration, so don't run too far ahead of them!
  
## The List of Future Tweaks

- **Dropped Items and XP Orbs merge faster and over slightly greater distances**.

- **Soul Fire does not destroy items dropped in it like normal fires do**.

- **"Refresh" the enchantments on offer for a price.**

- **Remove "Too Expensive" limitation on repairs and enchanting and just have a max cost instead.**
  
- **Universal dyes - allow recoloring of colored Wool and Terracotta, not just white Wool and 
  "plain" Terracotta.**
  - Possibly add the ability to re-dye Concrete Powder as well, but not the "hardened" Concrete.
    
- **Introduce the ability to "pulverize" concrete to get it back into its dust form.**

- **Skeletons hit by lightning can turn into Wither Skeletons.**

- **Disable the "Custom Worlds" warning that just isn't any fun any more.**

- **Feather Falling reduces the risk of trampling crops.**
