# Fett.lol Mod

This mod adds a number of minor tweaks that were desired on the `fett.lol` Minecraft server. Some of these are inspired by other mods, where we just wanted a small portion of what that mod did and did not want to install the entire mod. Others are completely novel and are of our own creation. Another couple are recreations of mods that have been lost to the sands of time as Minecraft continued to be updated while the mod was not.

Note that this mod does not currently have any configuration associated with it. In future updates, we will be adding the possibility to turn each of these tweaks on or off.

## The List of Implemented Tweaks

- A new "Egg Collector" enchant for weapons adds a 3% chance for mobs to drop their spawn eggs when killed.
- Bows with "Infinity" enchant no longer require an arrow in the inventory.
- Diamond Ore can drop "Soul Shards", nine of which combine to make a "Soul Gem".
- All recipes are unlocked from the beginning, except certain recipes which are gated behind progression.
- Multiple changes to various chest and mob loot tables.
- Poisoned Potatoes can be composted.
- Spawners have a recipe which includes, amongst other things, A Soul Gem, a Nether Star and a Totem of Undying.
- The "Infinity" and "Mending" enchantments can coexist on bows.
- Large collection of Player Heads for sale at a new type of Wandering Trader called "Wandering Headhunter".
- When building your first Waystone, get a second one for free!

## An Assorted List of Ideas for Future Tweaks

- **Dropped Items and XP Orbs merge faster and over slightly greater distances**.

- **"Refresh" the enchantments on offer for a price.** 
  - Not sure if this price should be XP, Lapis or something else.

- **Universal dyes - allow recoloring of colored Wool and Terracotta, not just white Wool and "plain" Terracotta.**
  - Possibly add the ability to re-dye Concrete Powder as well, but not the "hardened" Concrete.

- **Introduce the ability to "pulverize" concrete to get it back into its dust form.**
  - I do not like the method I have seen in some mods where concrete hit by a falling anvil turns into powder, some other method would be preferrable.

- **Skeletons hit by lightning can turn into Wither Skeletons.**

- **Introduce a set of colored blocks that slime does not stick to.** 
  - This would be a block that can be used inside of flying machine-based farms etc that removes the need to build them with Furnaces, Glazed Terracotta or leaves. I'm thinking something more like being able to coat concrete blocks with honey, giving a more 'glossy' version of the concrete block? This could be useful in building as well.

- *... and more.*
