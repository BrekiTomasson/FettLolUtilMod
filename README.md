# Fett.lol Mod

This mod adds a number of minor tweaks that were desired on the `fett.lol` Minecraft server. Some of these are inspired by other mods, where we just wanted a small portion of what that mod did and did not want to install the entire mod. Others are completely novel and are of our own creation. Another couple are recreations of mods that have been lost to the sands of time as Minecraft continued to be updated while the mod was not.

## The List of Implemented Tweaks

- A new "Egg Collector" enchant for weapons adds a 3% chance for mobs to drop their spawn eggs when killed.
- Bows with "Infinity" enchant no longer require an arrow in the inventory.
- Diamond Ore can drop "Soul Shards", nine of which combine to make a "Soul Gem".
- All recipes are unlocked from the beginning, except certain recipes which are gated behind progression.
- Multiple changes to various chest and mob loot tables.
- Poisoned Potatoes can be composted.
- Spawners have a recipe which includes, amongst other things, A Soul Gem, a Nether Star and a Totem of Undying.
- The "Infinity" and "Mending" enchantments can coexist on bows.
- Large collection of Player Heads for sale at a new type of Wandering Trader called "Wandering Headhunter".
- When building your first Waystone, get a second one for free!
  - *Requires the "Waystones" mod to also be installed*
